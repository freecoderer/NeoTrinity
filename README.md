## Overview
Neo Trinity is a blockchain-based platform designed to enhance security and transparency in campus rental and voting systems. This project aims to leverage blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and tamper-proof solution for managing various campus activities.

## Project Goals
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement a secure system for campus rentals and voting to prevent tampering and ensure transparency.
- **Decentralization**: Utilize blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform, reducing the reliance on central authorities.
- **User Authentication**: Provide a robust and secure method for user authentication and authorization.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain-Based Voting System**: Utilize blockchain to create a transparent and immutable voting system, ensuring the integrity of votes.
- **Secure Rental Management**: Implement a blockchain-based rental system for campus facilities, preventing unauthorized access and tampering.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for secure and private user authentication without revealing sensitive information.
- **IoT Integration**: Integrate IoT devices to automate and secure the process of accessing rented facilities.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
### Blockchain
- **Ethereum/Solidity**: For developing smart contracts that handle voting and rental management on the blockchain.

### Programming Languages
- **Python**: For backend processing and integrating blockchain with the application.
- **JavaScript/React**: For developing the front-end user interface.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data and rental/voting records.

### IoT
